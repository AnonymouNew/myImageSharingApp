# myImageSharingApp
## Hello there!

### This is my Android App project which is primarily used to view and share memes with just one click.

### This app is designed in such a way that it extracts the random data from Reddit. Used Volley, Glide Library, Volley Singleton Class and Glide Response Library.

## *I have used this Api:*
### https://meme-api.herokuapp.com/gimme
### https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api

## **Here are some Screenshots of the application:**
